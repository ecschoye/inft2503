## Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to system programming languages in Unix-like systems, focusing primarily on C++. Throughout the course, we will compare C++ with other relevant system programming languages, such as C and Rust. The objective is to develop resource-efficient software with optimal memory utilization, energy efficiency, and faster runtime compared to higher-level languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript.

## Content

The course covers the following topics:

1. Resource Management in System Programming Languages
Understanding the concept of resource acquisition is initialization (RAII)
Pointers, smart pointers, and references for efficient resource handling
2. Object-Oriented Programming in System Programming Languages
Exploring object-oriented programming in C++, including the use of structs
Multiple inheritance in C++ and traits in Rust
3. Error Handling
Different forms of error handling in system programming languages
4. Containers
Exploring various types of containers for data storage and retrieval
5. Functional Algorithms
Introduction to functional algorithms and their application in system programming languages
6. Constant Expressions and Template Meta-programming
Utilizing constant expressions and template meta-programming techniques
7. Parallelization and Asynchronous Programming
Advantages and disadvantages of parallelization and asynchronous programming in system programming
8. Operator Overloading
Understanding and implementing operator overloading in system programming languages
